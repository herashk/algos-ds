Study Lists

Data Structures
- Arrays
- Dictionaries
- Strings
    * (differences between array and hash tables in look ups, array has easy access but difficult modification)
- Linked Lists
    * singly & doubly linked list
    * reverse linked Lists
    * recursively reverse linked Lists
    * runner example
    * determine if a linked list has a cycle
    * sort linked list
    * merge sorted linked list
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Binary Trees
    * Tree traversals (BFS & DFS) - differences
    * depth and height of trees
    * in order traversal VS level order traversal
    * Heaps * Binary Heaps (array implementation)
    * self balancing binary trees
    * red-black trees
    * AVL trees
    * trie
- Graphs
    * linked lists, trees, etc are all just part of graphs
    * directed acyclic graph (DAG)
    * multiple edges & loops
    * connectivity
    * weighted graphs
    * coloring
    * adjacency list, adjacency matrix
    * graph traversals (DFS & BFS and their differences)
    * shortest path trees (Dijkstra's algorithm)
    * Bellman-Ford algorithm
    * minimum spanning tree

Algorithms
- Sorting
    * binary search
    * bubble sort & selection sort and how they suck (On^2)
    * merge sort
    * quick sort
    * randomized quick sort
    * topological sort
    * longest common subsequence
    * knapsack problem
    * radix sort

Bit manipulation?

Advanced Algorithms & Data Structures (to be completed later)

System Design & Distributed System
- scoping, abstract design, botlenecks, scalability
- database shsarding
- concurrency
    * consistent/available
    * consistent/partitionable
    * available/partitionable
    * eventual consistency (weak consistency) 
        > causal consistency
        > read-your-writes consistency
        > session consistency
        > monotonic read consistency
        > monotonic write consistency
- ACID vs BASE
- asynchronous vs synchronous


Front-End
- HTML & CSS
    * https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/
    * https://learnlayout.com
    * inifinite scrolling
    * color picker
    * date picker
    * carousel
    * positioning (Static, relative, absolute, fixed)
    * display (block, inline, inline-block)
    * box model
    * CSS specificity
    * flexbox
    * grids
    * transitions

- JavaScript
    * Scope
    * Closures
    * Prototypal Inheritance
    * OOP 
    * Async  
        > callbacks
        > promises
        > async/await
        > generators
        > implement a basic Promise helper/library from scratch
    * dom manipulation (querying & manipulation)
    * implemenet 'getElemtnsByClassName' using recursion

- React
    * data binding (1 and 2 way)
    * state management (Redux)
    * build a small React project

- Web
    * HTTPS, HTTP1, HTTP2
    * how internet/HTTP works
    * Web security on a higher level (CSRF, XSS)
    * Authentication (cookies, sessions, JWT)
    * web accessibility
