What are they?
- they are collection of values, the relationships among them and 
  the functions or operations sthat can be applied to the data
- different data structures excel at different things
- some are highly specialized while others like (arrays) are more
  generally used

Why do I care?
- the more time ou spend as a developer, you'll be more likely to 
  use one of these
- you've already worked with many of them unknowingly!!
  (ex - DOM = tree)

Static methods on a class
- the static keyword defines a static method for a class
- Static methods are called without instantiating their class and cannot
  be called through a class instance
- They are often used to create utility functions for an app
- they are not related to a particular instance!!
- Gotcha with 'this' - inside all the instance methods and constructor
  the keyword 'this' refers to the object creataed from that class(instance),
  not to the class itself
